Authors of the RPAL interpreter:

Daniel Franke <dfranke@cise.ufl.edu>.
Maintainer. Wrote the initial version in one continuous hacking run.

Manuel Bermudez <manuel@cise.ufl.edu>.
Daniel's research advisor. Wrote the syntax and operational semantics from 
which the interpreter is derived.

F. Russell Tyndall <russ@acceleration.net>.
Thoroughly abused my code throughout a semester of CIS5555 and smoked out
some bugs in the process.

The RPAL language was designed at MIT in the early 70's by Wozencraft and
Evans.
