This PAL distribution provides some of the documents in PDF form
relating to the PAL language developed at MIT between 1967 and 1969.
See pal/docs/pal-ref-man.pdf (in this distribution) for details.

The PAL compiler was written in BCPL but has been lost. However, I
plan to resurrect it to run under Cintcode BCPL using scraps of
working documentation I still have. It will consist of a simple
compiler and interpreter derived from the VSPL system. The interpreter
will follow the structure of the CSED blackboard machine. No attemp
will be made to make this implementation efficient.

The directory pal/docs contains various pdf documents.

pal/pal.b will eventually be the Pal compiler and interpreter.
Initialially this is just the vspl compiler and interpreter.

I will be away fpr much of the next three months and so progress
will be slow.
