This is rpal, an interpreter for the Right-reference Pedagogic Algorithmic
Language. This interpreter is written and maintained by Daniel Franke. It
shares no code with (but will hopefully replace, eventually) the interpreter
by the same name authored by Prof. Manuel Bermudez.

REQUIREMENTS
	rpal aims to be portable to any POSIX-like system, including Cygwin
	and Darwin/OS X.

	rpal requires GNU Guile. It is actively developed against the 1.6 
	version series, but ought to also work with 1.4 and possibly earlier
	versions.  Guile is available from http://www.gnu.org/software/guile.

	To compile rpal, you will need lex and yacc in addition to the
	standard UNIX tool-chain. Most any combination of lex/flex and
	yacc/byacc/bison should be adequate.

	rpal's manpage is generated from Docbook. In the distribution, the
	manpage comes pre-generated, but if you want to make changes to it
	you will need an XSLT processor.  Currently the build system can
	automatically detect and use either xsltproc or saxon.

	See the file INSTALL for building and installation instructions.

OBTAINING RPAL
	The latest version of rpal is available from http://rpal.sf.net.

LANGUAGE DOCUMENTATION
	The closest thing that RPAL has to documentation is the transduction
	grammar and operational semantics provided by Prof. Bermudez. These
	are available in PDF form in the doc/ directory of this distribution.

CONTRIBUTING
	Any contributions to rpal's development are welcome and appreciated.
	You can particularly help us out by submitting your RPAL programs for
	use as test cases.
